Hello!

I'm Zach, a software engineer with a strong interest in both web and game development. My journey in tech has led me to specialize in full-stack JavaScript development, encompassing technologies like Node.js, React, and Vue.js. I'm also deeply passionate about game development, particularly using Unreal Engine 5 with C++.

I'm excited to be a part of this team and look forward to contributing my skills and learning from everyone.

Lets Grow together!

Zach.
